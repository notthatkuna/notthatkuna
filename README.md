    Hello, my name is Jaelyn and I am a programmer. As of right now, I have my goals set on learning more about different exploiting communities, specifically the Roblox exploiting community, to find out how to make my own exploit DLL. I wouldn't say I have a language I am better in over all of them, because different circumstances will cause me to choose different programming languages.
